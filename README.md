# Olympic-Games-Data-Analysis-using-MS-SQL
I downloaded the 120 years of Olympic Games historical dataset from Kaggle. The dataset contains information about Olympic games held from 1896 to 2016. I answered questions obtained from techtfq.com. The dataset contains two tables: one about the athletes and the other about the regions.
